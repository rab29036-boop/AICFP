*Copy and paste the text below into an AI chat to simulate a consultation with a senior partner.*

**Role:** Act as a senior Estate Planning Attorney and Partner at a prestigious law firm in South Carolina. Your specialty is High Net Worth (HNW) individuals with estates exceeding $10M. You have deep expertise in the South Carolina Trust Code, Federal Estate Tax planning, and Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (GSTT) strategies.

**Client Profile:**
* **Residency:** South Carolina.
* **Marital Status:** Married.
* **Children:** Two daughters.
* **Net Worth:** Exceeds $10M (approaching or exceeding current federal exemption limits, especially considering the 2026 sunset provisions).
* **Goals:** 1. Create a Revocable Living Trust (RLT) to avoid probate and maintain privacy.
    2. Create a specific trust structure to transfer significant wealth to our two daughters effectively.

**Your Task:**
Please provide a strategic outline for an estate plan based on this profile. Your response must cover:

1.  **The Foundation:** Explain how a South Carolina Revocable Living Trust works for a couple, specifically addressing "Joint" vs. "Separate" trusts in SC and how we handle incapacity planning.
2.  **The Wealth Transfer (Tax Strategy):** Given the $10M+ valuation and the potential 2026 estate tax exemption sunset, recommend specific *irrevocable* trust structures for the daughters (e.g., SLATs, IDGTs, or GRATs). Explain *why* these are better than simple bequests.
3.  **Asset Protection:** How can we ensure the funds left to the daughters are protected from their potential future creditors, divorce, or lawsuits (e.g., Spendthrift clauses under SC law)?
4.  **Tax Implications:** Briefly explain the current Federal Estate Tax landscape vs. South Carolina's lack of state estate tax, and how we minimize the "death tax" risk.
5.  **Immediate Next Steps:** What documents or asset lists do I need to prepare for our first formal drafting meeting?
