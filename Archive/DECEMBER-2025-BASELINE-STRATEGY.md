# December 2025 Baseline Strategy
## Official Portfolio Benchmark for 2026 Pressure Testing

**Date Established:** December 28, 2025
**Status:** BASELINE - Reference Point for Future Analysis
**Purpose:** Preserve complete strategy for quarterly pressure testing throughout 2026
**Next Review:** March 31, 2026 (Q1 2026 pressure test)

---

## I. Document Purpose

This document preserves the complete portfolio strategy developed in December 2025 as the **official baseline** for ongoing analysis throughout 2026 and beyond.

### Why This Matters

As markets evolve in 2026, we will return to this baseline multiple times to:
- **Pressure test assumptions** against actual market developments
- **Validate theme convictions** (tech, infrastructure, longevity)
- **Adjust allocations** if fundamentals change
- **Monitor performance** vs. expectations
- **Rebalance intelligently** based on evidence

This is NOT a "set and forget" plan. It's a living strategy that will be refined quarterly based on real-world data while maintaining core convictions.

## III. Theme Allocation - December 2025 Baseline

### **Portfolio Composition by Secular Theme:**

| Theme | % of Portfolio | $ Amount | Expected CAGR | Key Holdings |
|:------|:--------------:|:--------:|:-------------:|:-------------|
| **Technology** | 35% | $2,075,000 | 14-16% | NVDA, META, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, CRM, NOW, PANW, CRWD |
| **Longevity/Healthspan** | 18% | $1,067,000 | 12-15% | LLY, ISRG, VRTX, GILD, ILMN, NVO, UNH |
| **Infrastructure/Energy** | 12% | $711,000 | 10-14% | NEE, EQIX, D, PWR, TT, DLR, COST |
| **Conservative/Index** | 35% | $2,075,000 | 6-9% | VTI, VXUS, BND, JNJ, PG, KO, PEP, ABBV, XOM, SGOV |

### **Rationale for Theme Mix:**
- **Tech (35%):** Core conviction in AI boom, concentrated in tax-free Roth
- **Longevity (18%):** Uncorrelated secular trend (0.5 correlation), GLP-1 drugs proven
- **Infrastructure (12%):** Complementary AI power thesis, lower correlation (0.75)
- **Conservative (35%):** Stability anchor, prevents forced selling, RMD income

**This balance provides:**
- Multiple uncorrelated growth drivers (not betting on one theme)
- Appropriate risk for 30-year horizon with $1.97M liquidity buffer
- Tax-optimized placement (growth in Roth, stability in eTrade)
- Smoother volatility (17% vs. 28% pure tech)

| 2033+ | $1,020,485 | -$175,000/yr | $0 | +$43,000/yr | Declines slowly |
| 2036 | | | | | **~$1,100,000** |

**Why This Matters:**
- **10+ year runway** without touching investments
- **Prevents forced selling** during market crashes
- **This is why you can be aggressive** in other accounts

| 2032 | $456,580 | $238,437 | $57,225 | $15,498 | $11,004 | $83,727 | Bob's Traditional |
| **TOTAL** | | **$1,346,177** | **$322,082** | **$87,505** | **$55,020** | **$464,607** | |

**Key Features:**
- Fills 24% federal bracket exactly (top of bracket inflates 2.5%/year)
- Marginal tax rate: 30.5% (24% federal + 6.5% SC state)
- IRMAA surcharges: $11,004/year for Medicare (years 2-6)
- All taxes paid from Wells Fargo (not withheld from IRA)
- Converts $1.35M at 24% rate (vs. 32-37% if waited until RMDs)

**Conversion Source Depletion:**

| Year | Traditional IRA Start | Growth (13%) | Conversion Out | End Balance |
|:-----|:--------------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| 2027 | $1,299,400 | $168,922 | -$210,744 | $1,257,578 |

| 2031 | $1,061,583 | $138,006 | -$232,622 | $966,967 |
| 2032 | $966,967 | $125,706 | -$238,437 | $854,236 |
| 2033+ | $854,236 | Growth only | $0 | **$1,347,000 (2036)** |

**Result:** Traditional IRA NOT fully depleted (residual $1.35M by 2036 after conversions)

## VIII. Quarterly Pressure Testing Framework

### **Purpose of Pressure Testing**

Throughout 2026, we will test this baseline strategy against real market conditions:

**Q1 2026 Review (March 31):**
- [ ] How did themes perform Q1? (tech, infrastructure, longevity)
- [ ] Any major theme invalidation? (e.g., GLP-1 drugs fail trials)
- [ ] Valuations vs. December 2025 baseline (cheaper or more expensive?)
- [ ] Should any allocations be adjusted?

**Q2 2026 Review (June 30):**
- [ ] 6-month DCA completion check (did we deploy as planned?)
- [ ] Year-to-date performance vs. expectations
- [ ] Geopolitical developments (China, tariffs, elections)
- [ ] Rebalancing needs (any positions drifted >5%?)

**Q3 2026 Review (September 30):**
- [ ] Pre-retirement check (Bob retires June 2026 - how's transition?)
- [ ] Wells Fargo spending vs. budget (on track for 10-year runway?)
- [ ] Market risk indicators (VIX, SKEW, valuations)
- [ ] Tax planning for 2027 conversion

**Q4 2026 Review (December 31):**
- [ ] Full year performance review
- [ ] Calculate 2027 Roth conversion amount (IRS bracket adjustments)
- [ ] Annual rebalancing decisions
- [ ] Update 10-year projections

### **Pressure Test Questions**

**For Each Theme:**
1. **Is the thesis still valid?** (secular trend intact or weakening?)
2. **Are valuations reasonable?** (expensive, fair, cheap vs. baseline?)
3. **Have fundamentals changed?** (earnings growth, competitive threats)
4. **Should allocation increase, decrease, or hold?**

**For Overall Portfolio:**
1. **Is 17% volatility acceptable?** (can we tolerate actual drawdowns?)
2. **Is Wells Fargo adequate?** (spending on track, no forced selling?)
3. **Are we staying the course?** (or panic-selling during corrections?)
4. **Should we adjust for new information?** (change strategy or stay disciplined?)

### **Action Triggers (When to Adjust)**

**INCREASE allocation if:**
- Theme thesis strengthens (e.g., GLP-1 drugs expand to new indications)
- Valuations become attractive (e.g., 30% pullback creates buying opportunity)
- New catalysts emerge (e.g., fusion energy breakthrough)

**DECREASE allocation if:**
- Theme thesis weakens (e.g., regulatory ban on AI, China invades Taiwan)
- Valuations become extreme (e.g., NVDA at 100x P/E with slowing growth)
- Better alternatives emerge (e.g., new theme with superior risk/reward)

**HOLD allocation if:**
- Theme thesis intact, normal volatility
- Valuations within reasonable range
- No major fundamental changes

**The goal:** Intelligent adaptation based on evidence, not emotional reactions to noise.

## IX. Risk Management - December 2025 Baseline

### **Portfolio Risk Metrics:**

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|:-------|:------|:-----------|
| **Expected Volatility** | 17% | Moderate (vs. 12% base, 28% pure tech) |
| **Maximum Drawdown** | -42% | Severe but survivable with Wells buffer |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 0.51 | Excellent risk-adjusted returns |
| **Beta to S&P 500** | 1.12 | Slightly more volatile than market |
| **Correlation to S&P** | 0.82 | High but not 1.0 (diversification working) |

### **Stress Test Results:**

**2008-2009 Financial Crisis Simulation:**
- Portfolio decline: -38%
- Recovery time: 2-3 years
- Wells Fargo remaining: $1.21M (4+ years runway)
- **Verdict: SURVIVABLE**

**2000-2002 Tech Crash Simulation:**
- Portfolio decline: -42%
- Recovery time: 3-4 years
- Wells Fargo remaining: $1.45M (6+ years runway)
- **Verdict: SURVIVABLE**

**1970s Stagflation Simulation:**
- Real returns: -18% purchasing power
- Infrastructure outperforms (utilities, energy)
- Wells Fargo rates rise with inflation
- **Verdict: UNCOMFORTABLE BUT MANAGEABLE**

**10-Year Depression (worst case):**
- No market growth 2027-2037
- Wells Fargo depletes to $450K (still solvent)
- Can wait for eventual recovery
- **Verdict: THIS IS WHY WELLS FARGO IS NON-NEGOTIABLE**

### **The Golden Rule:**

**NEVER sell investments during corrections to fund living expenses.**

Wells Fargo exists precisely to prevent this fatal mistake. Markets always recover eventually. Forced selling locks in permanent losses.

## XI. Monitoring & Rebalancing Protocols

### **Quarterly Reviews (4-5 hours each):**

**Tasks:**
1. Review performance vs. expectations (each account, each theme)
2. Check for drift >5% from target allocations
3. Assess theme fundamentals (any thesis changes?)
4. Update 10-year projections
5. Document observations for year-end review

**When to Rebalance:**
- Any position drifts >3% from target (e.g., NVDA 15% → 18.5%)
- Any account allocation drifts >5% from target
- Major market event creates extreme valuations
- Theme thesis changes materially

**How to Rebalance:**
- Sell overweight positions
- Buy underweight positions
- Use tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts (N/A for IRAs)
- Coordinate with annual Roth conversions (2027-2032)

### **Annual Planning (12-16 hours):**

**December Tasks:**
1. Calculate next year's Roth conversion (IRS bracket inflation)
2. Review full year performance vs. baseline
3. Update 10-year projections with actual returns
4. Assess all themes for thesis changes
5. Make annual rebalancing decisions
6. Plan next year's strategy adjustments (if any)

**January Tasks:**
1. Execute annual Roth conversion
2. Pay taxes from Wells Fargo
3. Implement any rebalancing trades
4. Update all documentation
5. Reset for new year

## XII. Success Metrics - How to Measure Progress

### **Annual Benchmarks (vs. This Baseline):**

**2028 Checkpoint:**
- Portfolio should be $7.2M-$8.5M (conservative-to-base case)
- Roth conversions on track ($210K + $216K completed)
- Wells Fargo $1.7M-$1.85M remaining
- No forced selling during volatility

**2030 Mid-Point:**
- Portfolio should be $8.5M-$11M
- Roth conversions 60% complete ($860K of $1.35M)
- Wells Fargo $1.3M-$1.55M remaining
- Staying disciplined through market cycles

**2033 RMD Start:**
- Portfolio should be $10M-$14M
- Roth conversions 100% complete
- Bob's RMDs begin (age 73)
- Wells Fargo refills from excess RMDs

**2036 Target:**
- Portfolio $11.5M-$15M (conservative to bull case)
- **Median expectation: $12.8M**
- Wells Fargo stabilized at $1M+
- Legacy wealth for daughters maximized

### **Red Flags (Warning Signs):**

**Portfolio Level:**
- 🚩 Underperforming base case by >15% for 2+ consecutive years
- 🚩 Volatility exceeding 25% (materially higher than 17% expectation)
- 🚩 Wells Fargo depleting faster than projected (forced selling risk)
- 🚩 Unable to maintain time commitment (28-36 hrs/year)

**Theme Level:**
- 🚩 Tech: Correlation to S&P 500 rises above 0.95 (losing diversification)
- 🚩 Infrastructure: Power demand growth <100% through 2030 (thesis weakening)
- 🚩 Longevity: GLP-1 drugs face regulatory ban or safety issues (thesis broken)

**Behavioral Level:**
- 🚩 Panic selling during corrections (emotional decision-making)
- 🚩 Chasing performance (buying high, selling low)
- 🚩 Ignoring discipline (not rebalancing when needed)
- 🚩 Losing conviction (second-guessing strategy constantly)

**If red flags appear:** Pause, pressure test assumptions, adjust intelligently (not emotionally).

## XIII. Estate Planning Integration

### **Trust Structure (Established):**
- **Bob & Susan Family Trust** (Joint Revocable)
- **Lifetime Heritage Trusts** for two daughters (upon death)
- **See-Through Conduit** language (IRA 10-year stretch compliance)
- **Asset protection** from divorce, creditors, lawsuits

### **Beneficiary Designations:**

**Primary Beneficiaries (All Accounts):**
- Bob's Roth IRA → The Bob & Susan Family Trust
- Bob's Traditional IRA → The Bob & Susan Family Trust
- eTrade IRA → The Bob & Susan Family Trust
- Susan's IRA → The Bob & Susan Family Trust
- Wells Fargo → The Bob & Susan Family Trust

**Successor Trustees:**
- Primary: Daughter A
- Secondary: Daughter B

### **Inheritance Timeline (If Bob/Susan Live to 85+):**

**2045 (Bob 85, Susan 95):**
- Estate passes to daughters via Family Trust
- Assets flow into Lifetime Heritage Trusts (asset protection)
- 10-year stretch begins for inherited IRAs

**Projected Inheritance Values (2045):**
- Bob's Roth IRA: $8,500,000+ (100% tax-free, 30 years compounding)
- eTrade IRA: $5,200,000 (taxable over 10-year stretch)
- Susan's IRA: $2,100,000 (taxable over 10-year stretch)
- Traditional IRA Residual: $800,000 (taxable)
- Wells Fargo Residual: $500,000 (taxable)
- Lake Murray Estate: $3,400,000 equity (step-up basis)
- **Total Gross: ~$20,500,000**

**After-Tax Net to Daughters:**
- Roth: $8.5M (tax-free)
- Taxable IRAs: $8.1M → $6.6M after taxes (10-year stretch optimization)
- Real estate: $3.4M (step-up basis, minimal tax)
- **Net Inheritance: ~$18.5M in protected trusts**

### **Tax Optimization for Daughters:**

**10-Year Stretch Strategy:**
- Years 1-3: Withdraw Roth only (tax-free, invest proceeds)
- Years 4-10: Distribute Traditional/eTrade across lower tax brackets
- Result: Minimize taxes, maximize after-tax inheritance

**Why This Matters:**
- Bob/Susan paid 24% on Roth conversions (2027-2032)
- Daughters avoid 32-37% brackets via smooth distributions
- **Tax savings: $800K-$1.2M vs. lump sum withdrawal**

## XV. Closing Statement

### **What This Baseline Represents**

This is NOT a "set and forget" plan. It is a **living strategy** based on:
- Three secular theme convictions (tech, infrastructure, longevity)
- 30-year investment horizon with tax-free Roth compounding
- Evidence-based decision-making (not emotional reactions)
- Quarterly pressure testing to validate or adjust assumptions
- Intelligent adaptation as markets evolve

### **The Core Principles (Never Change These)**

1. **Wells Fargo is non-negotiable** - $1.97M liquidity buffer prevents forced selling
2. **Tax optimization matters** - Roth conversions at 24% save daughters $800K-$1.2M
3. **Theme diversification** - Multiple uncorrelated growth drivers reduce volatility
4. **Discipline over emotion** - Hold through corrections, rebalance intelligently
5. **Time is the advantage** - 30-year horizon allows tax-free compounding to work

### **What Will Change (And That's Okay)**

- **Specific allocations** may adjust based on valuations and fundamentals
- **Theme weightings** may shift if thesis strengthens or weakens
- **Individual stocks** may be replaced if better alternatives emerge
- **Risk levels** may be dialed up or down based on age/circumstances

**But the core strategy remains:** Maximize wealth creation for daughters through tax-optimized, theme-diversified, long-term investing with disciplined risk management.
