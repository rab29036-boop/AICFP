# Checkpoint: Susan's IRA & eTrade IRA Portfolio Strategy
## Discussion Document - January 1, 2026

**Status:** CHECKPOINT - For Review Before Finalization
**Date Created:** January 1, 2026
**Version:** 1.0
**Purpose:** Preserve the discussion and proposed changes for Susan's IRA and eTrade IRA
**Next Step:** Review alongside Bob's Unified Portfolio checkpoint, then finalize decisions

---

## I. Context and Rationale

### The Questions That Started This Discussion

After finalizing Bob's Unified Portfolio strategy (12 stocks, $1.62M), we revisited the December 2025 Baseline assumptions for the remaining accounts:

1. **Susan's IRA ($778,700):** Original plan was 9 dividend-focused stocks. But if we're only withdrawing RMDs forever, is dividend income the right strategy?

2. **eTrade IRA ($1,562,300):** Original plan was 80/20 index + 7-stock overlay. But if this is a safety backstop we hope to never touch, should it be more growth-oriented?

### Original Baseline Allocations

| Account | Original Strategy | Holdings | Expected CAGR |
|:--------|:------------------|:---------|:-------------:|
| Susan's IRA | Dividend/Income | 9 stocks (JNJ, PG, KO, etc.) | 8% |
| eTrade IRA | 80/20 Index + Overlay | VTI/BND + 7 stocks | 10% |

### Why Changes Are Warranted

**Susan's IRA - The Case for Growth:**
- RMDs are covered by pension + Social Security ($253K/year)
- Account will never be liquidated during lifetime
- Ultimate purpose: Legacy to daughters under SECURE Act 2.0 (10-year stretch)
- Dividend strategy optimizes for income we don't need
- Growth strategy maximizes legacy value

**eTrade IRA - The Case for 100% Equity:**
- Safety backstop, hope to never touch
- 20+ year effective time horizon (won't access until 80s if at all)
- Wells Fargo ($1.97M in SGOV) already provides liquidity buffer
- 20% bond allocation is unnecessary drag on returns
- Simplification reduces complexity without sacrificing safety

## II. Joint CIO/Estate Planning Attorney Analysis

### CIO Perspective (Investment Optimization)

**Susan's IRA Analysis:**
- Current 9-stock dividend portfolio yields ~3% but limits capital appreciation
- At 11% CAGR vs 8%, the 10-year difference is substantial:
  - 8% CAGR: $778,700 → $1,681,000 by 2036
  - 11% CAGR: $778,700 → $2,211,000 by 2036
  - **Delta: $530,000 additional legacy value**

**eTrade IRA Analysis:**
- Current 80/20 + overlay introduces unnecessary complexity
- At 11% CAGR vs 10%, modest but meaningful improvement:
  - 10% CAGR: $1,562,300 → $4,053,000 by 2036
  - 11% CAGR: $1,562,300 → $4,437,000 by 2036
  - **Delta: $384,000 additional value**

### Estate Planning Attorney Perspective (Legacy Optimization)

**SECURE Act 2.0 Implications:**
- Daughters will inherit under 10-year stretch rule
- Must fully distribute within 10 years of inheritance
- Growth-oriented portfolio maximizes what daughters receive
- No step-up in basis for IRAs (all distributions taxed as ordinary income)

**Tax-Efficient Legacy Strategy:**
- Higher account values = more to distribute over 10 years
- Daughters likely in lower tax brackets than Bob/Susan during distribution
- Growth stocks defer gains until forced distribution
- Dividend stocks create phantom income (dividends reinvested but not distributed)

**Recommendation:** Shift both accounts toward growth to maximize legacy value.

## III. Proposed Portfolio: Susan's IRA

### New Allocation ($778,700)

| # | Ticker | Asset Class | Weight | Dollar Amount | Rationale |
|:-:|:-------|:------------|:------:|:-------------:|:----------|
| 1 | **VTI** | US Total Market | 50% | $389,350 | Core diversified US exposure |
| 2 | **VUG** | US Growth | 25% | $194,675 | Growth tilt for legacy maximization |
| 3 | **VXUS** | International | 15% | $116,805 | Geographic diversification |
| 4 | **BND** | US Bonds | 10% | $77,870 | Modest stability given Susan's age |

### Key Characteristics

| Metric | Value |
|:-------|:-----:|
| **Total Positions** | 4 ETFs |
| **Equity Allocation** | 90% |
| **Bond Allocation** | 10% |
| **US vs International** | 75% / 15% |
| **Expected CAGR** | 11% |
| **Expense Ratio (Weighted)** | 0.04% |

### Why This Allocation

1. **VTI (50%):** Provides broad US market exposure with low cost, captures overall market growth
2. **VUG (25%):** Growth tilt increases expected returns for legacy purposes
3. **VXUS (15%):** International diversification reduces US-only concentration risk
4. **BND (10%):** Small bond allocation respects Susan's age (73) while not dragging returns significantly

### Comparison: Original vs Proposed

| Metric | Original (9 Stocks) | Proposed (4 ETFs) | Change |
|:-------|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|:------:|
| **Positions** | 9 | 4 | -5 |
| **Expected CAGR** | 8% | 11% | +3% |
| **2036 Projected Value** | $1,681,000 | $2,211,000 | +$530,000 |
| **Dividend Yield** | ~3% | ~1.5% | -1.5% |
| **Complexity** | High | Low | Much simpler |
| **Expense Ratio** | N/A | 0.04% | Minimal |

### What Gets Eliminated (9 Positions)

| Ticker | Company | Reason for Removal |
|:-------|:--------|:-------------------|
| JNJ | Johnson & Johnson | Dividend focus not needed |
| PG | Procter & Gamble | Dividend focus not needed |
| KO | Coca-Cola | Dividend focus not needed |
| PEP | PepsiCo | Dividend focus not needed |
| MMM | 3M | Dividend focus not needed |
| ABT | Abbott Labs | Dividend focus not needed |
| MRK | Merck | Dividend focus not needed |
| BMY | Bristol-Myers | Dividend focus not needed |
| ABBV | AbbVie | Dividend focus not needed |

## IV. Proposed Portfolio: eTrade IRA

### New Allocation ($1,562,300)

| # | Ticker | Asset Class | Weight | Dollar Amount | Rationale |
|:-:|:-------|:------------|:------:|:-------------:|:----------|
| 1 | **VTI** | US Total Market | 60% | $937,380 | Core diversified US exposure |
| 2 | **VXUS** | International | 25% | $390,575 | Geographic diversification |
| 3 | **VUG** | US Growth | 15% | $234,345 | Growth tilt for long-term compounding |

### Key Characteristics

| Metric | Value |
|:-------|:-----:|
| **Total Positions** | 3 ETFs |
| **Equity Allocation** | 100% |
| **Bond Allocation** | 0% |
| **US vs International** | 75% / 25% |
| **Expected CAGR** | 11% |
| **Expense Ratio (Weighted)** | 0.04% |

### Why This Allocation

1. **VTI (60%):** Core US market exposure, highly diversified, extremely low cost
2. **VXUS (25%):** International diversification for global growth capture
3. **VUG (15%):** Growth tilt to enhance long-term compounding

### Why No Bonds

- Wells Fargo ($1.97M in SGOV) already provides the liquidity buffer
- eTrade is a backstop we hope to never touch
- 20+ year effective time horizon supports 100% equity
- Bonds would drag returns by ~1% CAGR without meaningful benefit

### Comparison: Original vs Proposed

| Metric | Original (80/20 + Overlay) | Proposed (3 ETFs) | Change |
|:-------|:--------------------------:|:-----------------:|:------:|
| **Positions** | 9 (VTI, BND, 7 stocks) | 3 | -6 |
| **Expected CAGR** | 10% | 11% | +1% |
| **2036 Projected Value** | $4,053,000 | $4,437,000 | +$384,000 |
| **Bond Allocation** | 20% | 0% | -20% |
| **Complexity** | Moderate | Very Low | Much simpler |
| **Expense Ratio** | ~0.05% | 0.04% | Minimal |

### What Gets Eliminated (7 Positions)

| Ticker | Asset | Reason for Removal |
|:-------|:------|:-------------------|
| BND | US Bonds (20%) | Unnecessary drag, liquidity in Wells Fargo |
| AAPL | Apple (overlay) | Simplification to pure index approach |
| MSFT | Microsoft (overlay) | Simplification to pure index approach |

## VI. Roth Conversion Integration

### How Susan's IRA and eTrade Fit the Overall Strategy

The Roth conversion strategy (2027-2032) remains unchanged:

| Year | Traditional → Roth | Taxes Paid From | Running Roth Balance |
|:-----|:------------------:|:----------------|---------------------:|
| 2027 | $238,000 | Wells Fargo | $556,000 |
| 2028 | $238,000 | Wells Fargo | $878,000 |
| 2029 | $238,000 | Wells Fargo | $1,247,000 |
| 2030 | $210,000 | Wells Fargo | $1,644,000 |
| 2031 | $210,000 | Wells Fargo | $2,098,000 |
| 2032 | $165,400 | Wells Fargo | $2,613,000 |

**Key Points:**
- Susan's IRA and eTrade IRA are NOT involved in Roth conversions
- Susan's IRA continues as Traditional (RMDs only)
- eTrade IRA remains untouched as safety backstop
- Only Bob's Traditional IRA feeds the Roth conversion pipeline

### Account Purposes Clarified

| Account | Primary Purpose | Secondary Purpose |
|:--------|:----------------|:------------------|
| **Wells Fargo** | Fund living expenses + Roth taxes | Permanent liquidity buffer (~$1.1M by 2036) |
| **Bob's Roth** | Tax-free growth, legacy | Late retirement spending |
| **Bob's Trad IRA** | Conversion source | Residual (~$1.35M by 2036) |
| **Susan's IRA** | RMD income, legacy | Emergency reserve |
| **eTrade IRA** | Safety backstop | Legacy if untouched |

| Bob's Roth IRA | 17% | $6,363,000 |
| Bob's Traditional IRA | 13% | $1,347,000 |
| Susan's IRA | 9.5% | $1,634,000 |
| eTrade IRA | 9.5% | $3,587,000 |
| Wells Fargo | 4.5% | $1,100,000 |
| **TOTAL** | | **$14,031,000** |

### Revised Unified Assumptions

| Account | CAGR | 2036 Value |
|:--------|:----:|:----------:|
| Bob's Unified (Roth + Trad) | 15.5% | $7,950,000 |
| Susan's IRA | 11% | $2,211,000 |
| eTrade IRA | 11% | $4,437,000 |
| Wells Fargo | 4.5% | $1,100,000 |
| **TOTAL** | | **$15,698,000** |

### Net Impact: +$1,667,000

| Change | Impact |
|:-------|:------:|
| Bob's IRA unification | +$240,000 |
| Susan's IRA optimization | +$577,000 |
| eTrade IRA optimization | +$850,000 |
| **Total Improvement** | **+$1,667,000** |

**Note:** These projections assume consistent returns. Actual results will vary based on market conditions.

## VIII. Risk Considerations

### Concentration Risk

The combined portfolio now has higher equity exposure:

| Metric | Original | Proposed | Change |
|:-------|:--------:|:--------:|:------:|
| Overall Equity % | ~75% | ~85% | +10% |
| Overall Bond % | ~15% | ~2% | -13% |
| Cash (Wells Fargo) | ~33% | ~33% | No change |

**Mitigation:**
- Wells Fargo ($1.97M in SGOV) provides 8+ years of living expenses
- No forced selling during market downturns
- Time horizon supports recovery from any correction

### Sequence of Returns Risk

**Concern:** Market crash during early retirement (2026-2030) could deplete Wells Fargo faster.

**Mitigation:**
- Wells Fargo sized for 8+ years at $147K/year + conversion taxes
- Can pause or reduce Roth conversions if markets crash
- Pensions + Social Security cover 77% of expenses regardless of market

### Simplification Trade-offs

**What We Gain:**
- Reduced positions (from 26+ to 20)
- Lower monitoring burden
- Clearer purpose for each account
- Higher expected returns

**What We Lose:**
- Some dividend income from Susan's IRA (~$23K/year)
- Individual stock selection optionality
- Defensive anchors in eTrade

---

## IX. Implementation Considerations

### If This Approach Is Adopted

**Susan's IRA Implementation:**
1. Sell all 9 dividend stocks (JNJ, PG, KO, PEP, MMM, ABT, MRK, BMY, ABBV)
2. Purchase: VTI (50%), VUG (25%), VXUS (15%), BND (10%)
3. No tax consequences (within IRA)
4. RMDs continue based on account value

**eTrade IRA Implementation:**
1. Sell BND and 7 overlay stocks
2. Sell existing VTI and BND allocations
3. Repurchase: VTI (60%), VXUS (25%), VUG (15%)
4. No tax consequences (within IRA)

**Timing:**
- Could implement before 2027
- Or coordinate with Q1 2026 pressure test (due March 31, 2026)

---

## X. Open Questions for Review

Before finalizing this approach, consider:

1. **Is 90/10 appropriate for Susan's IRA given her age (73)?**
   - Could increase BND to 20% for more stability
   - Trade-off: ~0.5% lower CAGR

2. **Should eTrade have any bond allocation?**
   - Current proposal is 100% equity
   - Could add 10% BND for psychological comfort
   - Wells Fargo already provides the safety net

3. **Is the dividend income from Susan's IRA needed?**
   - Original strategy generated ~$23K/year in dividends
   - Proposed strategy generates ~$12K/year
   - Pensions + SS already cover expenses

4. **Should we add international to Bob's Unified?**
   - Currently 100% US stocks
   - Susan's and eTrade have international exposure
   - Overall portfolio is ~13% international

---

## XI. Next Steps

1. **Review this checkpoint** alongside Bob's Unified Portfolio checkpoint

2. **Decide on final allocations** for Susan's IRA and eTrade IRA

3. **Update December 2025 Baseline Strategy** if changes are approved

4. **Prepare for Q1 2026 pressure test** - Due March 31, 2026

5. **Consider second objective** - Whether $13.2M baseline should be revised (now potentially $14.6M)
